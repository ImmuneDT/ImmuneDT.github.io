        ImmunoGIT: A Repository of Models and Metadata for Human Immune System Responses
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
    ImmunoGIT is a repository focused on extracting, enriching, and organizing computational models related to immune system responses. It allows interacting with the BioModels platform to retrieve SBML and SBML-QUAL models, enriching their metadata with relevant biological descriptions, and centralizing them with a user-friendly interface.
