<p>The Building Immune Digital Twins (BIDT) Working Group is part of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/" target="_blank">Research Data Alliance (RDA)</a>, a global initiative dedicated to advancing open, cross-disciplinary data sharing and interoperability.</p>
<p>The RDA BIDT Working Group brings together experts from diverse fields — including immunology, computational modeling, data science, clinical research, and ethics — to explore the development of Immune Digital Twins: virtual models of the human immune system that can support personalized medicine, vaccine development, and disease research.</p>

Together, we work to identify the scientific, technical, ethical, and social challenges involved in building and using Immune Digital Twins. Our goals include:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
    <li>Establishing community standards for data formats, model sharing, and metadata</li>
    <li>Promoting interoperability across tools, platforms, and datasets</li>
    <li>Fostering global collaboration through open science principles</li>
    <li>Creating a roadmap for long-term development and sustainability of immune digital twin ecosystems</li>
</ul>

We welcome researchers and stakeholders from all related fields to contribute to this emerging and impactful area.
